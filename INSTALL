If you can download the pre-built RPM's and use them, that is the easiest!
Otherwise you can build your own either by rebuilding the .src.rpm with
rpmbuild or as follows:

make
	Build client and server in place.

make rpms
	Build RPM packages directly from subversion (ignoring the
	local source tree except for the contents of the META file,
	Makefile, etc., which is used to calculate the subversion URL.

make rpms-trunk
	Build RPM packages from the subversion trunk.
	The resulting packages will have a special snapshot release number,
	e.g. lmt-client-2.6.2-0907031743

make rpms-working
	Build RPM packages from the current working directory.
	The resulting packages will have a special snapshot release number.


When building RPM's, the spec file BuildRequires will ensure that the
correct dependent packages are installed.  When building with 'make',
you will need to do this manually.  See the spec file for the definitive
rules.  At the time of this writing I am building LMT on CHAOS 4.2 which
is based on RHEL 5.3, with the following package versions:

ant-1.6.5-2jpp.2
ant-nodeps-1.6.5-2jpp.2
mysql-5.0.45-7.el5
mysql-devel-5.0.45-7.el5
cerebro-1.9-1.ch4.2
ncurses-5.5-24.20060715
ncurses-devel-5.5-24.20060715
java-1.5.0-ibm-1.5.0.10-1jpp.4.el5 (provides "jre")
java-1.5.0-ibm-devel-1.5.0.10-1jpp.4.el5 (provides "java-devel")

My lustre servers have:
cerebro-1.9-1.ch4.2
mysql-5.0.45-7.el5
lustre-1.6.6-110chaos_2.6.18_73chaos.ch4.2
lmt-server-agent-2.6.2-1.ch4.2

My management node has:
cerebro-1.9-1.ch4.2
mysql-5.0.45-7.el5
mysql-server-5.0.45-7.el5
lmt-server-2.6.2-0907031743.ch4.1

And my desktop has:
lmt-client-2.6.2-0907031743.ch4.1
java-1.5.0-ibm-1.5.0.10-1jpp.4.el5
ncurses-5.5-24.20060715
