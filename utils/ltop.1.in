.SH NAME
ltop \- display live information about a Lustre file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ltop [OPTIONS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ltop
displays information about a live Lustre file system monitored by LMT.
.SH OPTIONS
.B ltop 
accepts the following command line options:
.TP
.I "-f,--filesystem FSNAME"
Monitor the file system named FSNAME.
You may monitor only one file system per \fBltop\fR session.
The default is to monitor the first file system found.
.TP
.I "-t,--sample-period SECS"
Change the display refresh period from the default of two seconds.
.TP
.I "-r,--record FILE"
Log raw data from the session to FILE, so it can be played back with \fI\-p\fR.
.TP
.I "-p,--play FILE"
Play back raw data from FILE recorded with \fI\-r\fR or with the
interactive \fIR\fR command.
.SH "OST FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP
\fIOST\fR
The ost index, in hex.  In the compressed view (c below), the number of OST's
on the OSS is displayed in parenthesis.
.TP
\fIS\fR
OSC status.  The MDS's view of the OST is shown here.  The OSC state is
abbreviated as follows:  \fIC\fR closed, \fIN\fR new, \fID\fR disconn,
\fIc\fR connecting, \fIr\fR replay, \fIl\fR replay_locks, \fIw\fR replay_wait,
\fIR\fR recover, \fIF\fR full, \fIE\fR evicted.  The normal state is \fIF\fR.
.TP
\fIOSS\fR
The OSS hostname.
.TP
\fIExp\fR
Export count.  There will be one export for each client mounting the
file system plus one for the MDS and one for the OST itself.
.TP
\fICR\fR
The number of (re-)connects per second.
.TP
\fIrMB/s\fR
Read megabytes per second.
.TP
\fIwMB/s\fR
Write megabytes per second.
.TP
\fIIOPS\fR
Bulk RPC's per second (read and write combined).
In an ideal world, all bulk I/O would be 1MB, i.e. equal to the sum of
\fIrMB/s\fR and \fIwMB/s\fR.
.TP
\fILOCKS\fR
The number of locks on OST resources currently granted.
.TP
\fILGR\fR
The lock grant rate.
.TP
\fILCR\fR
The lock cancellation rate.
.TP
\fI%cpu
The percentage of cpu in use on the OSS.
.TP
\fI%mem
The percentage of memory in use on the OSS.
.TP
\fI%spc
The percentage of OST storage space in use.
.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.B ltop
responds to the following single character commands interactively:
.TP
\fIq\fR
Terminate the
.B ltop
program.
.TP
\fIPageDown\fR
Page down through OST information if it won't fit on screen.
.TP
\fIPageUp\fR
Page up through OST information if it won't fit on screen.
.TP
\fIc\fR
Toggle compressed OST view.  The default mode is to display one line per OST.
In compressed mode, one line per OSS is displayed.  Numerical data is summed
in the OSS view except for the export count where the minimum export count
of any OST is displayed.  Also if any of the OST's is in recovery, recovery
information for that OST will be shown in the OSS view.
.TP
\fI>\fR
Sort OST/OSS view by the next field to the right, wrapping around at the end.
Initially, entries are sorted by the leftmost field, OST index.
.TP
\fI<\fR
Sort OST/OSS view by the next field to the left, wrapping around at the end.
Initially, entries are sorted by the leftmost field, OST index.
.TP
\fIs\fR
Sort by OSS name, ascending order.
.TP
\fIx\fR
Sort by export count, ascending order.
.TP
\fIC\fR
Sort by (re-)connect rate, descending order.
.TP
\fIr\fR
Sort by read bandwidth, descending order.
.TP
\fIw\fR
Sort by write bandwidth, descending order.
.TP
\fIi\fR
Sort by IOPS, descending order.
.TP
\fIl\fR
Sort by lock count, descending order.
.TP
\fIg\fR
Sort by lock grant rate, descending order.
.TP
\fIL\fR
Sort by lock cancellation rate, descending order.
.TP
\fIu\fR
Sort by percent cpu utilization, descending order.
.TP
\fIm\fR
Sort by percent memory utilization , descending order.
.TP
\fIS\fR
Sort by percent disk space utilization , descending order.
.TP
\fIDOWN\fR
Move cursor down.
.TP
\fIUP\fR
Move cursor up.
.TP
\fISPACE\fR
Tag/untag OST/OSS under cursor.  Tagged OST/OSS's are underlined.
.TP
\fIDEL\fR
Park cursor and clear all tags.
.TP
\fIR\fR
Toggle record mode on/off.  Unless a file name was specified with the
\fI\-r\fR command line option, a file named \fIltop.log\fR will be used.
.TP
\fIp\fR
Pause data collection/playback.
.TP
\fIRIGHT\fR
Fast forward playback by one sample period.
.TP
\fILEFT\fR
Rewind playback by one sample period.
.TP
\fITAB\fR
Fast forward playback by one minute.
.TP
\fIBACKSPACE\fR
