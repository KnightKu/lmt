========================================================================

Fixes for various issues.  More detail is available via the issues tab at:

http://code.google.com/p/lmt/

* Issue 20: ltop error message not correct
  Make ltop error message more clear when no file system data is present.

* Issue 22: lmt_db_host setting does not work
  Add double quotes to lmt.conf man page option descriptions.

* Issue 27: Installation documentation is still not very clear
  Fix lmtsh getopt to handle --help sensibly.

* Issue 29: ltop doesn't report correctly OSTs information
  Fix bug that made the last OST in a single-page display invisible.

* Issue 30: ltop improperly truncates oss names
  Left truncate hostnames in ltop column to preserve numerical suffixes.

* Issue 33: ltop shouldn't try to parse lmt.conf
  Ltop doesn't use lmt.conf info so why should it fail if lmt.conf has error?

* Issue 34: old monitor module can't grok new router metric data
  Fix lmt3 router metric version string so it works with both lmt3 and lmt2.

* Issue 41: LMT Router Bandwidth Variable Needed For Aggregation Script
  This missing row in ROUTER_VARIABLE_INFO broke router aggregation.
  Add to schema script so it will be created for new database configs.

* Issue 43: existing ROUTER_INFO entries conflict with lmt3 autoconf entries
  Manually adding routers to the database while lmt is running caused problems.
  Add a couple of new error messages that would make this easier to debug.

* Issue 44: mkusers.sql doesn't include host 
  The mkusers.sql script provided should include @localhost for lwatchclient.

* Once a database has been created for a particular file system, its
  Lustre configuration is determined on the fly as servers report in.

* ltop now interfaces directly with cerebro (not mysql).  See ltop(1).

* There is one config file for database users, etc: /etc/lmt/lmt.conf,
  see lmt.conf(5)

* Protocol has been updated.  The old protocol is supported for migration:
  1) Update monitor (mysql server) node first, then
  2) update metric (lustre servers) second.

* Logging and error handling is improved.

* lwatch client is now released in separate lmt-gui package.
