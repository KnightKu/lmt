* Once a database has been created for a particular file system, its
  Lustre configuration is determined on the fly as servers report in.

* ltop now interfaces directly with cerebro (not mysql).  See ltop(1).

* There is one config file for database users, etc: /etc/lmt/lmt.conf,
  see lmt.conf(5)

* Protocol has been updated.  The old protocol is supported for migration:
  1) Update monitor (mysql server) node first, then
  2) update metric (lustre servers) second.

* Logging and error handling is improved.

* lwatch client is now released in separate lmt-gui package.
