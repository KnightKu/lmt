	* : Do not try to contact the local database for the
	configuration of a particular filesystem, instead
	read from the admin-only-readable configuration file
	/usr/share/lmt/cron/lmtrc.  This should make it possible
	to write to non-local databases and also password-protect
	databases if necessary.
	
2008-02-13 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.5.4

	* : Created an initial manpage for create_lmtconfig.

2008-02-12 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Update create_lmtconfig to include uuids to the
	script file.  This should help to make this less LLNL
	specific.  Still need to have some documentation for
	the config file though. Cleanup whitespace.
	Also make a manpage for create_lmtconfig and its
	configuration file.

2008-01-28 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.5.3

	* : Fix coverity bugs found.
	run 16:
	    cid-1765,
	    cid-1766,
	    cid-1767,
	    cid-1768,
	    cid-1769,
	    cid-1770,
	    cid-1771

2008-01-25 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.5.2

	* : Removed debug statements when polling for a particular
	lustre service and the service is not found.

2008-01-24 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Fix bz197ch.  Need to report iowait time with the cpu usage.
	Also use unsigned long long to hold the cpu usage.

2008-01-16 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.5.1

	* : Fix ost crashing bug bz173.  Also made sure to initialize
	some variables that weren't properly being initialized which could
	lead to inconsistent behavior.

	* : Ensure that we always build with debugging symbols
	and highest optimization level of -O2.  Do not strip libraries
	when building rpms.

	* : Instead of specofocall looking for the numrefs file
	just skip over all non directories.  This makes the
	readdir code more generic.

2008-01-12 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : close mds directory after use.

2008-01-11 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.5.0

	* : Add in fix to ensure that if cerebro is running
	before mds is started, that the mds module will still
	successfully load.  When the mds is finally started
	the module will function properly.

2008-01-10 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Only install the *.so files to the cerebro module directory.

2008-01-08 Herb Wartens <hwartems@llnl.gov>

	* : Added initial functionality for automatic ost detection.
	Now the parent thread will try to check if a thread is running
	and restart threads for any ost service that is not currently
	running.

	* : Fixed units for ost_read and ost_write.

	* : Try to address mds issue.  I suspect that the problem
	was that I was using an int for the number of samples.
	Even this number can get pretty large.  Try using an
	unsigned long long here.  Also print out a more verbose
	error to help track down which metric was causing an issue.

2008-01-07 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Properly use prepared statement for router as well.

	* : Fixed client to properly get CPU usage for the OSS data.
	Also modified ltop to stop displaying CPU usage for the
	OST data.  Now it will only be shown with the OSS data.

2007-12-28 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Modified xwatchadmin and xwatchclient accounts to
	lwatchadmin and lwatchclient respectively. Added a global
	SCHEMA_VERSION field to the FILESYSTEM_INFO table.

	* : Fixed CEREBRO_MODULE_DIR to point to proper directory.
	Fixed function typo for
	common_metric_lmt_destroy_metric_value_do_nothing.
	Removed insertion success lines that were being sent to
	/var/log/messages.

2007-12-27 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : When installing the rpm estart cerebrod if it is currently running.
	Compile with -Wall. Fix some compile warnings

	* : Use cerebro_err_debug instead old macro CEREBRO_DBG

	* : Updated the monitor module to handle the mysql
	server stopping/crashing from underneath it.
	There is still an issue at initial reconnection where
	some values inserted seem to be incorrect.

	* : Added in new server source

2007-12-26 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Rebasing code to 2.5 branch to prepare for removal of old
	python server code.

	allow for longer mds oeration name lengths.

2007-12-13 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* server/cron/lmt_agg.cron : Updated file to make sure to set
	and pass $keep properly to lmt_agg.sh

2007-10-11 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.1.0

	* lmt.spec : Updated specfile to ensure that we are building with
	glibc-2.5-18 or greater on chaos4 systems due to glibc bug.  Also
	make sure to require ncurses-devel.

	* scripts/build-lmt-client.sh: If JAVA_HOME is not set try to use the
	default redhat location, so that jni.h is properly found.

2007-10-05 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* Makefile : Updated Makefile to check out latest copy of build
	script and use that for building rpms.

	* : Tagging lmt-2.0.8

	* scripts/install-lmt-server.sh : Make the install-lmt-server.sh
	actually build the *.pyc and *.pyo files.

	* : Tagging lmt-2.0.7

	* lmt.spec : Removed the lmt-legacy client.  This means no
	more wxpython! =)
	Modified the name of xwatch-collector to lmtupdatedb.

	* doc/schema.txt : Added in a flat file for the current schema.

2007-10-02 Herb Wartens <wartens2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tagging lmt-2.0.6

	* lmt.spec : Removed the default atrributes for most executables
	so that rpm will decide what the defaults should be.  Hopefully
	it will pick sane defaults.

2007-10-02 Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>

	* lmt.spec : If chaos4, update BuildRequires and package stray 
	pyo files.

2007-10-01 Paul Spencer <spencer9@llnl.gov>

	    elements between the last click and the current
	    one are toggled on history plot frame.

	* : Added "Now" button to the "End" time interval as
	    a shortcut for setting the "End" time to the current
	    time on history plot frame.

	* : Changed "RawLive" granularity specification to
	    "Heartbeat" on history plot frame.

	* : When more than 8 curves are specified on history plot frame,
	    the legend is supressed. This fixes the problem where too
	    much real estate was being consumed by the legend.

	: * Cursor is now changed to "WAIT_CURSOR" when data is
	    being (re)loaded.

	* : Default granualrity, plot interval and refresh rate
	    for history plot was changed to "RAW", 2 hours, and
	    15 seconds. Future plans are for this to be driven
	    by preferences or last setting.

	* : Added Hide/Show buttons to collapse and re-display
	    the control panel and overview panel on the history
	    plot frame.
