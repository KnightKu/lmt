# LMT Configuration File - Cron Version
#
# This version of the file is for use with the data aggregation scripts launched by cron
# (or by hand). As those scripts require write access, make sure that dbuser below is
# a read/write user in mysql. Note that locally the read/write user is only allowed 
# access from localhost, so make sure to use 127.0.0.1 for the dbhost below.
#
# The cron script will by default process the first filesystem listed in this file, although
# that behavior can be changed by editing the lmt.cron file.
