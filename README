LMT - Lustre Monitoring Tool

LMT is a distributed system that provides a "top"-like display of the
activity levels of the server-side (MDS, OSSes, and LNET routers)
nodes of one or more Lustre-based filesystems.  It is possible to watch
server metrics in real time, and to graph past behavior.  The clients
provide this capability, but it is also possible to directly mine the
MySQL database, e.g. with SQL scripts and GNU plot.

Real time and historical data is kept in the MySQL datbase.  LMT clients,
lwatch (GUI - java/swing), ltop (curses - java/charva), and lstat
(java -command line) speak only to MySQL.  The clients are part of the
lmt-client RPM.

There are four Cerebro "metric modules", lmt_mds, lmt_oss, lmt_ost, and
lmt_router, which collect data from /proc on servers and inject messages
into the cerebro monitoring network.  The collection plugins are part of the
lmt-server-agent RPM.

Cerebro data is extracted and inserted into the database by a single cerebro
"monitor module".  The monitor module and various scripts for initializing,
migrating, and munging the database data are part of the lmt-server RPM.

Because the clients and data collection are separate and communicate only
via the database, we were able to develop LMT 2.0 in phases.  In Phase 1,
the original LMT 1.0 data collection software was modified to inject data
into MySQL and the new clients were written.  In Phase 2, data collection
was moved to Cerebro.
